# To Do

## General

- [ ] Create README.md
- [ ] Create unit-objectives.md to outline what each assignment's objectives are

## Unit 1 Assignment

- [X] Declare strings that outline student information from assignment guidelines
- [X] Declare constant variables for prices and AI parameters
- [X] Convert the string value for Units Taken to an integer data type and place the converted numeric value into a separate numeric variable
- [X] Increment above variable by 1
- [X] Calculate the initial tuition by multiplying the constant variable for price per unit by the units taken
- [X] Apply the AI-adjusted discount and store the result
- [X] Calculate the AI-recommended monthly payment by dividing the discounted tuition by 12
- [X] Display data
	- Student information
	- Number of units taken
	- Original tuition amount
	- AI-adjusted discount amount
	- Final tuition after discount
	- AI-recommended monthly payment

## Unit 2 Assignment

### Section 1 - Sentiment Analysis Comparisons

- [X] Insert comment w section title and what this section does related to AI decision-making
- [X] Request two sentiment scores from user
- [X] Compare entered sentiment scores with all logical operators
- [X] Print interpretation of comparisons

### Section 2 - Image Classification Confidence

- [X] Insert comment w section title and what this section does related to AI decision-making
- [X] Request a confidence score from user
- [X] Construct if-else statement to compare entered score with a threshold of 70
    - If >= 70, print "Classification confidence sufficient for automated decision."
    - If <= 70, print "Human review required due to low confidence."

### Section 3 - Machine Learning (ML) Model Selection

- [X] Insert comment w section title and what this section does related to AI decision-making
- [X] Request a number input between 1-12
    - 1-3 = supervised learning
    - 4-6 = unsupervised learning
    - 7-9 = reinforcement learning
    - 10-12 = deep learning
- [X] Using is-else-if statements determine category and specific algorithm type
- [X] Print selected algorithm type and common use cases (found in pseudocode file)
- [X] Include a default error message for invalid number input

### Section 4 - Neural Network Layer Types

- [X] Insert comment w section title and what this section does related to AI decision-making
- [X] Request a number input between 1-7
    - 1 = input layer
    - 2 = convolutional layer
    - 3 = pooling layer
    - 4 = dense layer
    - 5 = dropout layer
    - 6 = activation layer
    - 7 = output layer
- [X] Construct switch statement to determing which layer was selected
- [X] Print selected layer with typical use cases and characteristics (found in pseudocode file)
- [X] Include a default error message for invalid number input
